                Being a creator myself, I can see from the perspective of my creator. When I see, touch or feel a creation of my own, I get a great deal of pleasure and pride in my work.
                To see my work to be used for God gives me even greater depth into the eyes and feelings of the creator in that as we as his sheep do His work, it fulfills our purpose and
                therefore makes the creator successful. When you create something and it doesn’t quite function as you intended it, it’s easy to give up on that project and move on to the next idea;
                or if the idea never makes it past the planning phase, a creator might scrap that idea completely. I am so thankful that my creator hasn’t given up on me. Grateful that He continues
                to develop me for the purpose He intends to use me. He could just as easily say I am beyond repair or to far gone to even mess with anymore, but He doesn’t!
                He breaks me down piece by piece and dives deep into the root of my being and as long as I allow Him in, He repairs every part of me. At times this is a simple process,
                however the deeper you go the more complex the problems become and the more difficult it is to fix. Sometimes, it might even hurt.
                In design, you may like the way something looks or feels, but sometimes taking that feature away actually makes the end result more beautiful and useful than it would have been.
