            <p class="story">Imagine you are standing before two apple trees. One has been well maintained,
            the other has been neglected. People in general, whether they have an eye for design or not,
            are automatically drawn to the better looking, well maintained tree. That is my drive.
            To make people from all walks of life, look at, migrate towards and fall in love with every 
            piece of design I create.</p>

        <h3>My Work</h3>
            <p class="mywork">At just 16 years old, I knew I loved to create. I knew I wanted to turn my hobby into a career.
                Many years later, and several projects behind me, I wasn’t satisfied with my career. 
                I knew I needed to step up, add to my skillsets and take my career to the next level. 
                UI/UX Design was the next step. Currently, I am a student at Kenzie Academy for UX Engineering
                and will graduate on July 23, 2020.</p>
        <h3>My Family</h3>
            <p class="family">Aside from design, I always knew I wanted to be a wife and mom. Finally at 22 years old,
                I met the love of my life. We met each other in November 2011, started dating in January 2012,
                we were engaged in May 2012, and married that October. We added our son Ethan in 2013 and our
                daughter Addison in 2016. We live and thrive in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.</p>
